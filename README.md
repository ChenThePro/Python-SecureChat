Python SecureChat project

This project, "SecureChat" is a project I have been working on for a month. It is the final's year project in my program engineering class of my school and it is worth 70% of my grade in the "Bagrot" of program engineering in israel - 3 units for the "Bagrot".

The purpose of the project is to provide companies private environment to communicate. I had a blast time making it and experimenting with a lot of featues and abilities which I hadn't known before. So I hope you would like it :)

I learnt and used a few tools to make this project. customtkinter, threading, en/decryption, DB and more!!!.

I also added my project documentation that I submitted to my school for anyone to look at it. It contains pictures of my project, explanations and code references, it might not be up to date but it contains most of my work. For reading my code I recommend just reading the git files server.py and client.py.
